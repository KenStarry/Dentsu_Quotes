Separately.

***

### Development Environment
The project was run and developed in **Android Studio** but you can use other IDEs such as **Intellij IDEA**, **Visual Studio Code** or any other IDE of your choice.

***

### Database Setup
The project has been setup to work with a `Supabase` backend instance. This means that you would require a `Public Anon Key` and the `URL` for the database. These shall be provided in the specified
email for the respective persons.

## Building Release APK

To build the APK in release mode, follow the following steps.

### 1. Generate Signing Keys
Run the following command at the command line:

MAC OS
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA \
        -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

On Windows, use the following command in PowerShell:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore yourPath\upload-keystore.jks ^
        -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 ^
        -alias key
```

### 2. Referencing the Keystore
Create a file named `[project]/android/key.properties` that contains a reference to your keystore. Donâ€™t include the angle brackets (< >). They indicate that the text serves as a placeholder for your values.

```
storePassword=<password-from-previous-step>
keyPassword=<password-from-previous-step>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<keystore-file-location>
```

### 3. Configure Signing in Gradle
1. Add the keystore information from your properties file before the android block:

```
   def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
   def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
   if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
       keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
   }

   android {
         ...
   }
```
Load the key.properties file into the keystoreProperties object.

2. Find the buildTypes block:

```
   buildTypes {
       release {
           // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
           // Signing with the debug keys for now,
           // so `flutter run --release` works.
           signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
       }
   }
```
And replace it with the following signing configuration info:

```
   signingConfigs {
       release {
           keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
           keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
           storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
           storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
       }
   }
   buildTypes {
       release {
           signingConfig signingConfigs.release
       }
   }

```

Yeey! Release builds of your app will now be signed automatically.
